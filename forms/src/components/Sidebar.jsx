          <h2>Revision Policy</h2>
          <p>
            All designs are created as proofs and sent to the client. Each design proof comes with three (3) revisions. After a client approves the final proof, we assume that there are no more revisions to be made and your project is marked as completed.
            <br /><br />
            Design revisions have a turnaround time of 3–5 business days. Due to our large project scope, general revisions are initiated and completed in the order received.
            <br /><br />
            If you pass this three-revision mark, you will be subject to an “Additional Revision” fee per revision (GHC 50).
            <br /><br />
            If for some reason you need a minor tweak such as wording after approving the final proof and haven’t exhausted your three (3) additional revisions, we may grant your request. The request would have to be made within two weeks of your project completion date. If it is outside of that two-week period, you will be subject to a “Redesign Charge” per design.
